The software loads in and parses Olympic games data and provides following:
(Data can be found in athletes.txt, events.txt files)

<pre>

Basic data manipulation:

The user should be able to display the following basic metrics:

● the total number of participants in all events at the Olympic Games
● the total number of disciplines at the Olympic Games
● the average height of all athletes (if the data on the height of the athlete is available)
● the average weight of all athletes (if the data on the weight of the athlete is available)

The user can filter data when printing basic metrics, based on one or more of the following criteria:

● filtering based on the given sport
● filtering based on the country for which the competitor is competing
● filtering based on the year of the Olympic Games
● filtering based on the type of event (individual or team)
● filtering based on the medal won (gold, silver, bronze, or no medal)

In addition to basic manipulations, the following should be provided:

● Determining the number of different sports in which the given country has won at least one medal
● Determining the top three countries in terms of success at the given Olympic Games
  (games are specified by the year they were held and the season they were held in).
  Success is better if a country has won more gold medals. If two countries have the same number of gold medals,
  the one with more silver medals is better, and if two countries have the same number of silver medals,
  the one with more bronze medals is better.
● Determining the countries that have achieved the best performance in at least one Olympic Games
● Determining the ten youngest participants in the Olympic Games who won a medal in their first participation
● Retrieving all pairs of countries and athletes, for all athletes who have won at least one individual medal and
  at least one team medal (not necessarily in the same year)
● Determining all athletes who participated in the given pair of Olympic Games
● Retrieving all teams that the given country had at the given Games, sorted first by the number of athletes
  in the team in descending order, and then lexicographically by the name of the discipline in which the team
  competes in ascending order
● Determining all cities where the Olympic Games were held at least once.
